# Lokathor's Ecosystem Guide

Here's some stuff I've written in Rust that you could reasonably make use of in your own projects:

* [bytemuck](https://docs.rs/bytemuck) - Safe transmute
* [tinyvec](https://docs.rs/tinyvec) - Safe "small vec" types
* [fermium](https://docs.rs/fermium) - Raw SDL2 bindings
* [yacurses](https://docs.rs/yacurses) - (Yet Another) safe Curses bindings crate
* [voladdress](https://docs.rs/voladdress) - Volatile memory access types
* [gl46](https://docs.rs/gl46) - OpenGL 4.6 bindings

And here's some other stuff that's more niche, though still cool:

* [utf16_lit](https://docs.rs/utf16_lit) - macro_rules to make UTF-16 literals
* [magnesium](https://docs.rs/magnesium) - core-only XML walking
* [chlorine](https://docs.rs/chlorine) - C types
* [wide](https://docs.rs/wide) - Safe portable-ish SIMD
* [safe_arch](https://docs.rs/safe_arch) - safe CPU intrinsics
