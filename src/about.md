# About The Blog

Hello.

This is a blog sort of thing but I'm using
[mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook) and not whatever you
probably usually use to make blogs.

# About Me

* I program Rust stuff.
  * In the past I've used mostly Java and Haskell, with the occasional "demo"
    scope projects in a few other languages (Python, Common Lisp, Erlang).
  * I **don't** really know C/C++ at all, but I can kinda read them a bit
    because I read though K&R once (a decade ago) and have watched well over 200
    [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) videos.
* Usually I make "video game engine" sorts of stuff that never turns into a
  shipped product (but check out
  [learn-gfx-hal](https://github.com/Lokathor/learn-gfx-hal) if you want an
  intro to `gfx-hal`).
* I don't like using too many dependencies that I didn't write myself. You might
  think to blame Handmade Hero, but I was like this even back when I was using
  Java in high school. Handmade Hero just happened to align with my existing
  notions.
* I'm totally comfortable with writing `unsafe` code if that's what's necessary.
* I've got a [ferris plushie](https://devswag.com/products/rust-ferris) sitting
  in front of my computer and so should you.

You can find me on the [Rust Community Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang) or
the [Rust With Blackjack Discord](https://discord.gg/N52JnV4).

Everything I say is both a joke and also for real at the same time.
