1) General clean out of old repositories that weren't doing anything useful.
   Released `yacurses-0.2.4` (terminal resizing!).
   Started updating `gba` to use `voladdress-0.4`.
   Got word that more people might want to use `fermium`,
   so I added a function that was missing that they wanted (more pending as they're reported).
   Added a small amount to `hektor`.
2) Fixed the `gba` PR.
   Did an amount of work on `vkvk` to add new raw functions and new rusty functions.
3) Released `gl-0.2.0`
   Released `fermium-20014.3.0`
4) Released `fermium-20014.4.0` and also `fermium-20014.4.1` (rip).
   Put in a PR to rust-lang/rust for bool::not (wip)
   Made a demo for `whist` because `@bitshiftmask` asked for someone to make such a thing.
   Added more docs to `gl33` about how to use a "get proc address" to load GL.
5) Pushed around code in `randomize`, but I guess didn't ultimately change much.
   Developed much more in `whist`, released 0.0.2.
   Finished the multiplication in `hektor`.
