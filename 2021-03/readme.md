1) General clean out of old repositories that weren't doing anything useful.
   Released `yacurses-0.2.4` (terminal resizing!).
   Started updating `gba` to use `voladdress-0.4`.
   Got word that more people might want to use `fermium`,
   so I added a function that was missing that they wanted (more pending as they're reported).
   Added a small amount to `hektor`.
2) ?
