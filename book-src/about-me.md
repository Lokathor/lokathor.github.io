# About Me

Hello, I'm Lokathor.

I program stuff in Rust, and this blog thing is about that.

Usually I program the "low level and unsafe" sort of stuff, and hopefully this blog is about that too.

Currently I'm _theoretically_ working on a [Decade Jam](https://itch.io/jam/decadejam) project. Though, since it's a decade long project we won't really know if I've slacked off too much and not done it for about a decade.

(Hint: I'll slack off a lot probably.)

# Crates

Here's some crates that I've done that I think are worth you trying out.
